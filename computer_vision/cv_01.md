# Accidental pinhole and pinspeck cameras: revealing the scene outside the picture
Antonio Torralba, William T. Freeman (2012)

## Pinhole cameras
- Smaller occluder or smaller window: sharper image, at the cost of increased noise
- Increase SNR: increase occluder size (up to windows size)
	- So: best results with small window and small occluder
- Limitation of pinhole cameras: images need to be taken from the same point
