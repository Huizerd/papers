# The plenoptic function and the elements of early vision
Edward H. Adelson, James R. Bergen (1991)

## Plenoptic function
- Like a color holographic movie: chunk of spacetime you can step into and look around
	- Concert with cellphones: samples of the PF in all 7 dimensions!
	- All information is potentially available (God vision)
- P(theta, phi) means: all variables but theta, phi are constant
	- Think of Google Streetview
- Human: 5/7 dimensions of the PF (only lacking Vy and Vz)
