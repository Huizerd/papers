# Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints
David G. Lowe (2004)

## SIFT
- Invariant to scaling and location, partially invariant to illumination and viewpoint
- Local: robust against occlusion, noise
- Highly distinctive
- Steps:
	1. Scale-space extrema detection
	2. Keypoint localization (reject poor contrast regions and edges, keep corners!)
	3. Orientation assignment
	4. Keypoint descriptor
- Matching: approximate nearest-neighbour, compare to 2nd-nearest neighbour: 1st-nearest neigbour must be considerably closer for a reliable match
