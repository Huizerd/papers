# KAZE features

## Key points
- Gaussian blurring does not respect natural boundaries and smoothes both details and noise
	- Loss in distinctiveness!
- So, instead of Gaussian scale-space: nonlinear diffusion filtering
	- Locally adaptive blurring that retains object boundaries
- Not used before, since inefficient
	- Solved through the use of additive operator splitting to build the scale-space efficiently
- Efficiency comparable to SIFT, with better detection and description!
