# ORB: an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF
Ethan Rublee, Vincent Rabaud, Kurt Konolige, Gary Bradski (2011)

## ORB
- Aimed at real-time
- Rotation invariant, resistant to noise due to BRIEF
- 2 orders of magnitude faster than SIFT, and better performance than SURF
- FAST keypoint detector + BRIEF descriptor
	- Addition of orientation component to FAST based on the intensity centroid of corners
	- Filter with Harris for corners (after applying FAST, which has no cornerness measure) + scale pyramid
	- Addition of learning step to BRIEF, to make it invariant to rotation (rBRIEF)
- Not scale invariant (was not addressed adequately)
