# Fixing the locally optimized RANSAC - full experimental evaluation
Karel Lebeda, Jiri Matas, Ondrej Chum (2012)

## Key points
- LO-RANSAC = RANSAC + local optimization step (iterative least squares)
	- Slow in cases of many inliers (either absolute or relative), so we want to improve
- LO+-RANSAC:
	- Very stable (almost non-random)
	- Limiting the number of inliers leads to reduced execution times + better precision
	- More robust to threshold choice (due to new cost function)
	- Better starting point for bundle adjustment
- LO'-RANSAC: lightweight version for "easy" matching (no large motion/viewpoint changes, illumination)
	- Up to 6x faster!
