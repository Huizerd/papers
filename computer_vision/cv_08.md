## Stitching
- Novel stitching method, smooth stitching field without bending artifacts and improved perspective in non-overlapping regions
- Achieved through:
	- Linearized homography in non-overlapping regions
	- Global similarity transform estimated from overlapping regions
	- So, in overlapping regions: smooth interpolation between local homography and global similarity
	- In non-overlapping regions: extrapolation using linearized homography and global similarity
- Mitigates perspective distortion and handles parallax issues well
- Fully automated, robust to parameter selection
