# Structure-from-motion revisited

## SfM
- Incremental SfM: correspondance search (feature extraction + matching, geometric validation through RANSAC and epipolar geometry) acts as a seed for incremental reconstruction (image registration, triangulation, bundle adjustment and outlier filtering)
- Choosing the proper seed (dense location + many overlapping cameras) is very important for accuracy and robustness
