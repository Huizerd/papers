# Structure-from-motion revisited
Johannes L. Sch√∂nberger, Jan-Michael Frahm (2016)

## Key points
- Incremental SfM: correspondence search (feature extraction + matching, geometric validation through RANSAC and epipolar geometry) acts as a seed for incremental reconstruction (image registration, triangulation, bundle adjustment and outlier filtering)
- Choosing the proper seed (dense location + many overlapping cameras) is very important for accuracy and robustness
