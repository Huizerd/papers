# Scene chronology
Kevin Matzen, Noah Snavely

## Scene chronology
- Change in appearance through time: set of spatio-temporal objects
- 2 pieces of information: visibility of points in images and timestamps on images
- Can handle many images sampled densely in time
- Inconsistencies of timestamps on many levels can be detected and filtered by the method
- However, photo misregistration can prevent accurate timestamp estimation
	- Photo in wrong place: messes op chronology locally
- Planar assumption is not always correct
- Assumption that objects come into existence/leave it only once is not always true
- Observations on edges of time often have no start/end
- Pipeline:
	1. 3D point cloud
	2. Visibility graph
	3. Per-patch time intervals
	4. Spatio-temporal graph
	5. Plane-time cuboids
	6. Visualization
