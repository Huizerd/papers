# In defense of the eight-point algorithm
Richard I. Hartley (1997)

## 8-point algo
- Original 8-point: very susceptible to noise
- 8-point + simple normalization for translation & scaling = not susceptible to noise, giving comparable performance to iterative solutions, while being roughly 20x faster!
- Linear, so fast and easily implemented
- 2 methods for normalization:
	- Isotropic: translate centroid of points to image origin + scale such that average distance from origin is sqrt(2)
	- Non-isotropic: principal moments both equal to 1
	- Isotropic is preferred, since it is as good as non-isotropic, but simpler
- For N = 8: no least squares minimization, so normalization has no effect
- Best approach: normalization > solution > constraint enforcement (fundamental matrix F has to have rank 2) > denormalization
- 8-point + normalization can also provide a good starting point for iterative algorithms
