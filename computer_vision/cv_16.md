# Multi-view stereo revisited

## MVS revisited
- Extremely simple, yet robust:
	1. Reconstruct depth map for each input view, using a robust version of window-matching with a small number of neighbouring views
	2. Merge resulting depth maps
- Reconstruct only portions of the scene that can be matched with high confidence in each input view
- Although merging fills holes and further improves overlapping areas, holes remain and completeness is not enforced!
	- This allows more complex geometry to be reconstructed!
- Advantages:
	- Dense, robust and very accurate
	- Confidence is provided for each reconstructed point
	- Easy to understand and implement
- Disadvantages:
	- Holes in areas with little texture
	- Each point must be seen in at least 3 views
