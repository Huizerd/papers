# ORB-SLAM2: an open-source SLAM system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras
Raúl Mur-Artal, Juan D. Tardós (2017)

## Key points
- Complete SLAM system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras
- Includes map-reuse, loop closing, relocalization capabilities
- Works in real-time and on standard CPUs
- Higher accuracy due to back-end based on bundle adjustment
- Lightweight localization mode that uses visual odometry in unmapped areas, and achieves zero-drift localization in already mapped areas
- Creates a globally consistent map
- Utilizes both close and far stereo/monocular keypoints:
	- Close: scale, translation, rotation
	- Far: rotation
	- Monocular: translation, rotation
- Stereo/RGB-D prevents the need for a structure-from-motion initialization (which is needed for monocular cameras)
- 3 parallel threads:
	1. tracking to localize camera for every frame (matching with local map + motion-only bundle adjustment)
	2. Local mapping to manage/optimize local map (local bundle adjustment)
	3. Loop closing to detect large loops and correct drift
- 4th thread (separate): full bundle adjustment
