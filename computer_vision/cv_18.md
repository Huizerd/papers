# A survey of Hough transform

## Hough transform
- Detecting lines: pixel in image > line/sinusoid in parameter space
	- Line of points in image: intersection of lines in parameter space
- Using the center of image as origin saves memory (-59%)
- Detecting circles: pixel in image > cone in 3D parameter space
	- Circle of points in image: common intersection of cones
	- If R known: only circles in parameter space, no cones
- Detecting ellipses: 5D parameter space
- Drawbacks of the standard Hough transform:
	- Computation time and memory need grow exponentially with number of curve parameters
	- High accuracy needs finer parameter quantization, again leading to higher processing time and memory
	- Uniform quantization in parameter space = non-uniform precision in detecting curves in image space
	- Errors lead to votes in vicinity of true parameters ("broad" peaks, so no precise maxima)
	- New feature detection = start separate transformation process
	- Noise is not considered when voting (votes not weighted)
	- Standard Hough transform cannot automatically detect end points of lines
- Generalized Hough transform: detects non-parametric curves through "learning phase"
- Probabilistic Hough transform: subset of data points to speed up Hough transform at minimal decrease in accuracy
- Digital Hough transform: considers errors due to image digitization
- Fuzzy Hough transform: shape is fuzzy (greyness and spatial ambiguities lead to imprecise bounds), detects shapes by approximately fitting data points to some given parametric shape
