# EpicFlow: edge-preserving interpolation of correspondences for optical flow
Jerome Revaud, Philippe Weinzaepfel, Zaid Harchaoui, Cordelia Schmid (2015)

## EpicFlow
- Optical flow estimation for large displacements with significant occlusions
- Approach:
	1. Dense matching by edge-preserving interpolation from a sparse set of matches: using edge-aware geodesic distance, which handles occlusions and motion boundaries (builds on the assumption that contours often coincide with motion discontinuities)
		- Using an approximation scheme (faster and no performance loss)
		- Geodesic distance: pixel belonging to a motion layer is close to all other pixels in the layer, but far from anything beyond the boundaries
	2. Variational energy minimization initialized with the dense matches
- In full: edges (using SED) from 1st image, matches with DeepMatch
	- Together dense interpolation > energy minimization
- Can be incorrect due to erros in:
	1. Sparse matches: regions take optical flow value of background
	2. Contour extraction: regions spread their own optical flow value to the background
