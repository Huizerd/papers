## Edge cameras
- Components: ground, visible scene, hidden scene, edge
- Ligt around a corner results in a penumbra gradient
	- 1D angular projection of the hidden scene
	- Upgrade to 2D with a double/stereo edge camera (such as a doorway!)
- Signal only 0.1% above background, but still very robust
