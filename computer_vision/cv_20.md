# Eulerian video magnification for revealing subtle changes in the world

## Eulerian video magnification
- Reveal temporal variations (both periodic and non-periodic) in videos that are impossible to see with the naked eye
	- Lower spatial frequency can be exaggerated more without introducting artifacts
- Spatial decomposition > temporal filtering > amplification for certain temporal frequency band of interest (e.g. heart rate)
	- Both color variation and small motion
- Temporal filtering needs sufficient spatial pooling to rise above noise
- Brightness constancy assumption used
- Lagrangian: trajectory of particles tracked over time
	- Computationally expensive due to accurate motion estimation and hard to make artifact-free
	- Better for enhancing fine point feature motion and large amplitudes
- Eulerian: properties of a voxel evolve over time
	- Motion is not explicitly estimated, but exaggerated by amplifying temporal color changes at fixed locations
	- Better for smoother structures and smaller amplitudes
