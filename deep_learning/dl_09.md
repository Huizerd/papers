# Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation
Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, Trevor Darrell (2015)

## Key points
- FCN to do semantic segmentation: which pixel belongs to which class?
    - Dense, so input size = output size
    - FCN: all layers are convolutional
- Use deconvolution as upsampling: "backwards" convolutions (stride 1/f) to get dense predictions (instead of decreased subsampling or shifting and stitching coarse outputs)
    - Learnable!
- Whole image training > patchwise training
- Add skips to combine coarse, high-level information with fine, low-level information
    - Prevent the loss of too much spatial information (during upsampling), and ensure the local details respect the global structure
- No pre- and post-processing needed!
